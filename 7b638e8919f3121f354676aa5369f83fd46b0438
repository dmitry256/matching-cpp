Due to the contingeonous nature of the underlying container, std::vector, can benefit from better cache locality and less calls to the memory manager comparing to std::map or other linked list type of containers; the flat_map might be a good condidate for this replacement, we can take advantage of faster price lookups and iterations, however, the insertion and deletion of price points might suffer, hence, a separate thread must be periodically watching for obsoleted price points with empty queues and purging them.
